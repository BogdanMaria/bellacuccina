### SEO

- For this project I implemented a strong SEO strategy for my BellaCuccina Market web-shop in my Django project. First, I conducted thorough keyword research to identify the most relevant long and short-tail keywords for my products. I optimized my title tags, meta descriptions, and URLs, ensuring they included these keywords to improve my web-shop's visibility in search engine results. I also focused on creating high-quality content that naturally incorporated the identified keywords. For images, I used descriptive file names and alt tags to enhance their optimization. to improve the visibility of my web-shop in search engine rankings and attract potential customers searching for related products., I strategically used internal and external linking techniques


### Marketing

#### Facebook business page

- To assist with marketing the website and further boost its visibility, I have included a link to the web-shop's own Facebook Business Page in the footer section. This reciprocal link establishes a connection between the website and its social media presence, allowing visitors to easily access the Facebook page for additional updates, promotions, and engagement with the brand. You can visit the web-shop's Facebook page by clicking [here](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?viewas=100000686899395&id=61560875649149).

### Colors

- In this project a carefully curated color palette has been implemented to create a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. The use of dark colors in the navigation and footer sections adds sophistication and draws attention to important elements, while a light background enhances readability and creates a pleasant browsing experience. The contrast between dark and light elements strikes a perfect balance between aesthetics and usability, showcasing the products effectively and providing an enjoyable browsing experience.

### Fonts

- For this Project "Rubik" font was used
    - The use of Rubik fonts brings numerous benefits. The font family offers a range of weights that allow for clear and legible text, enhancing readability throughout the website. The modern and versatile design of Rubik fonts adds a touch of professionalism and sophistication to the overall aesthetic. With its balanced proportions and clean lines, Rubik fonts create a harmonious visual experience, ensuring that the content is easily digestible and
    visually appealing to users

- Templates: The project includes a base-level folder containing fundamental templates that are extended throughout other templates such as base.html, navigation, toast messages files and footer.html. It also includes templates for user authentication. Additionally, each app within the project has its own templates folder with HTML files that support the specific functionality and promote reusability within the app.
- Static: The project includes a "static" directory that contains the base CSS and JavaScript files. This directory serves as a central location for storing and organizing the static assets used throughout the project. In addition to the base-level files, each app within the project may have its own static directory to house CSS and JavaScript files specific to that app's functionality.

## Agile Design

### Overview

- For this project Agile principles and design was implemented from a start since this was the 2nd time in my development career that im implementing agile. While process was familiar, plan was set from beginning and it was adjusted along the way. Drawing from my previous experience, I knew that Agile would empower me to embrace change and prioritize tasks efficiently, ensuring that I consistently delivered incremental value to my project.I leveraged techniques such as user stories,kanban boards an milestones to maintain a clear project vision.This time kanban board are constructed by iterations(sprints)This iterative development cycle gave mae a regular chance to review and try to refine my work.Overall, learning and implementing Agile as a solo developer working on my e-commerce project has been a highly rewarding experience.By implementing Agile principles and design, I was confident in delivering a high-quality and user-focused e-commerce solution.

### Epics(Milestones)
- By effectively leveraging GitHub's 'Milestones' feature and thoughtfully connecting user stories to their corresponding tasks.

<details><summary>See epics</summary>

### User stories

- I started by creating a user story template using GitHub issues. As the project progressed, these initial rough sketches evolved and were refined into complete user stories.

</details>


Using Agile methodologies for my solo e-commerce project, I made steady progress by breaking tasks into smaller parts. This approach allowed me to prioritize and deliver important features step by step. With continuous feedback and adjustments, I improved the development environment, implemented crucial functionalities, and built a user-friendly e-commerce platform. Agile proved to be a valuable framework, helping me navigate complexities, achieve tangible results, and prioritize user satisfaction.
